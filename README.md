<h2>The problem RoziRoti solves</h2>
<p> We all know the plight of migrant labourers post-COVID-19. A lot of the daily-wage-workers rushed to their homes in villages when the lockdown was instated. Now that these restrictions are being lifted, it's a real challenge for them to find employment. A lot of old businesses have been shut down and many others are running at a reduced capacity. Workers can use their simple Feature Phones to register themselves on a nationwide database of workers actively seeking for employment by just entering details on their roziroti app which is KAIOS based ; and the employers can list and see the list of applicants on the web portal . Also to add the laboures have a functionality to search the job within a specified radius . All the jobs in the specified radius are filterd out and user can apply to the desired type of job by filling a simple form .</p>


<h2> Challenges we ran into</h2>
<p>
As roziroti is based on both web and native app (feature phone based like jio phone), the main issues we faced were using KAIOS and developing the native app .we did overcome it by reading tons and tons of documentation just to understand how KAIOS works and do we configre the manifest.webapp file to run the app on kaiOS Devices .
